Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Road Safety Surveillance: This model can be utilized by traffic control departments to monitor whether motorcyclists are adhering to regulations such as helmet wearing. If the system detects helmet-less motorcyclists, it can quickly alert authorities or take automatic actions, improving safety on the roads.

2. Autonomous Driving: Autonomous vehicles technology can benefit from this model. The ability to correctly identify motorcycles on the road and motorcyclists wearing helmets can enhance the safety features of these self-driving vehicles.

3. Motorbike Race Events: The model could be used during motorbike race events to monitor the safety of the event, ensuring that all participants are wearing their helmets during the event.

4. Insurance Claims: Insurance companies could use this model to verify claims related to motorcycle accidents. It can provide an accurate picture of whether or not safety measures were being adhered to at the time of an incident.

5. Law Enforcement Training: The model can serve as a training tool for law enforcement officials to learn and identify different types of motorcycles and the importance of helmet safety practices.
